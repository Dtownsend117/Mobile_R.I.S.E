HOW TO GET R.I.S.E:
-Download the zip file
-Extract the zip to your desktop(preferably into a new folder to keep all files together)
-launch R.I.S.E.bat 
-Enjoy

Things to know about this project:
1.) I built this years ago and only made minor adjustments to upload it to GitHub
2.) Some issues still need to be worked out
3.) There is no microphone support, just text chat

\/ STILL NEED FIXED \/
Since I have moved on from this project to focus on other work, the following issues are still in the program:
- the news command either dims the screen or opens a brief cmd window, requires a Rise restart
- The health report command requires an elevated CMD window to display


FOR STARTING:
-To get the best use of R.I.S.E, you will first need to go to the scripts folder located in the Mobile R.I.S.E folder
-Locate the "enableWSH" Registry file, double click to install it, and then click OK on the windows that appear after it
-Below it, double-click the "nircmd" file and repeat the process you did with the registry file
-Any other files in the scripts folder need to be left alone otherwise there could be major damage to the system
-If you want the program on your desktop, create a copy of all files(or shortcut R.I.S.E), otherwise, it will not work

FOR TYPING:
-each command will need to be typed in all lowercase to work

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
-Windows Operating System (any version)
-Command Prompt
-Narrator's voice

FOR ADMINISTRATOR:
-When giving a copy, change each variation of (Boss) to what the user wants to be called

OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION
-When opened, a command prompt window will open for the program to run
-There will be bugs and glitches from time to time(in the cmd window, not the system)
-This is a BETA version
-Only modify scripts and files if you know exactly what you are doing, otherwise you could damage Rise and your system.
-Some features might not be available depending on the administrator of the system, Those features include: Weather, News, Speech
-Some of these features can still work depending on how strict the administrator is
-Some commands will redirect you to another window to complete a task(web browser, another cmd window, program)
